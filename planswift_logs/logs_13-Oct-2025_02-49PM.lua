Today I added part codes as a property to the 1.2 sheet width parts that populate from the area template.
The logic resides in the formula feild of the "Part Code" property of the "1.2 sized" part.

Status of the code as of 13-Oct-2025_02-49PM: function has only some data entered in, will need to be completed and verified with kirk at later date
